# How can you write your own book?

If you have never written your own book, it's a difficult prospect. 
How do you go from idea to execution, let alone publication? From base camp the mountain range seems just brutal.
## Coaching helps. Here's why
The right coach will help you:

* find the method that works for you
* build a writing practice
* troubleshoot issues that come up, from emotion to lifestyle
* connect you to others, such as book marketers
* provide expert editorial feedback 
* keep you on track and accountable.

### How does it work?

The most important thing about working with a coach is that you can work together! That's why we'll have one 30-minute call to see if we're "right" for each other.
If you decide that, yes, this could be awesome, here's how it works:

* You commit to paying $580 AUD per month, for a minimum of 6 months
* Together we set expectations for the relationship, on both sides. Rules make things work!
* You get 1 x 60-minute call every month
* You get support via WhatsApp, to bounce ideas and get feedback between calls

But if you're not committed to the work, it won't work. Writing books is hard work, so know that ahead of time.

### Who is my coach?

Your coach is [Leticia Mooney](http://biodagar.com/about), who describes herself as a 'born writer'. She is a professional writer & editor by training; she has owned a publishing house, and produced books for herself and others; she has experience in publishing production both online and offline. Leticia's company [Brutal Pixie](https://brutalpixie.com) now brings her production expertise to complex industries like law, engineering, finance and health. She is a highly experienced coach and mentor, and has spent much of her life working to improve the style and talent of writers.
