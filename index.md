If you have never written your own book, it's a difficult prospect. 

How do you go from idea to execution, let alone publication? 

## Coaching helps. Here's why.
The right coach will help you:

* find the method that works for you
* build a writing practice
* troubleshoot issues that come up, from emotion to lifestyle
* connect you to others, such as book marketers
* support you with connections to learning opportunities as they arise
* get expert editorial feedback 
* keep you on track and accountable
* lavish you with praise when it's due
* be endlessly encouraging (when all your friends and family are scoffing at you).

### Step 1: Get all the freebies!

Snap up your FREE hour-long consultation. If you want another one four weeks later, it'll be a full coaching call, and you also get that for free.

Decide afterwards if you want to continue.

### Step 2: Feel the brilliance of creation, decide you want more of it

If you do, you can choose **either alone or in a group**.

Here's how it works. 

* You get 1 x 60-minute call every month
* You set your direction with support, prompting (or challenge) from your coach
* You get support via WhatsApp, Signal or Telegram, for your own growth, to bounce ideas and get feedback between calls.

You start working. Remember, inspiration has to find you working. :)

#### Pricing: Individual vs Groups
$490*/month for individuals
$490*/month for groups of 5.

So if you have 4 friends who also want to write, you pay $116* per month each. 

And if you don't have any friends (because, let's face it, you're a writer and spend most of your time alone), [put your name on the list](https://brutalpixie.typeform.com/to/n55yGQ). As soon as we have our next 5 on the list, we'll launch the next group.

* All prices are in Australian dollars, and include GST.
