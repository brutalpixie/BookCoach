If you have never written your own book, it's a difficult prospect. 

How do you go from idea to execution, let alone publication? 

## Coaching helps. Here's why.
The right coach will help you:

* find the method that works for you
* build a writing practice
* troubleshoot issues that come up, from emotion to lifestyle
* connect you to others, such as book marketers
* support you with connections to learning opportunities as they arise
* get expert editorial feedback 
* keep you on track and accountable
* lavish you with praise when it's due
* be endlessly encouraging (when all your friends and family are scoffing at you).

### How does it work?

The most important thing about working with a coach is knowing that you can work together! 

That's why we'll have 1 x 30-minute call to see if we're "right" for each other. After this, if you decide that this could be the most awesome thing ever, here's what will happen:

* You commit to paying $580 AUD per month, for a minimum of 3 months
* Together we set expectations for the relationship, on both sides. Great rules make things work!
* You get 1 x 60-minute call every month
* You get support via WhatsApp, to bounce ideas and get feedback between calls.

But if you're not committed to the work, it won't work. Writing books is hard work, so know that ahead of time.

### Whoa, man, I can't afford that!

Lucky for you, there's another option. 

By joining a Group List, you'll pay just $116 AUD per month. Once there is enough people on the list, you will join a monthly, 5-person call. If you have 4 keen friends, it's a great option.

GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS: It's cheaper

BAD THINGS ABOUT THIS: Waiting sucks, and you don't get personal attention to help you grow as an artist.
