#How can you write your own book?
If you have never written your own book, it's a difficult prospect. Going from idea to execution, let alone publication, seems like an insurmountable mountain range.
## Coaching helps. Here's why
The right coach will help you:

* find the method that works for you
* build a writing practice
* troubleshoot issues that come up, from emotion to lifestyle
* connect you to others, such as book marketers
* provide expert editorial feedback 
* keep you on track and accountable.
