If you have never written your own book, it's a difficult prospect. 

How do you go from idea to execution, let alone publication? 

## Coaching helps. Here's why.
The right coach will help you:

* find the method that works for you
* build a writing practice
* troubleshoot issues that come up, from emotion to lifestyle
* connect you to others, such as book marketers
* support you with connections to learning opportunities as they arise
* get expert editorial feedback 
* keep you on track and accountable
* lavish you with praise when it's due
* be endlessly encouraging (when all your friends and family are scoffing at you).

### How does it work?

The most important thing about working with a coach is knowing that you can work together! 

That's why you get a FREE consultation for up to an hour + your first coaching call also for free. 

Then, if you decide that this could be the most awesome thing ever, here's what will happen:

* You commit to paying $490 (AUD) per month
* Together we set expectations for the relationship, on both sides. Great rules make things work!
* You get 1 x 60-minute call every month
* You get support via WhatsApp, Signal or Telegram, for your own growth, to bounce ideas and get feedback between calls.

But if you're not committed to the work, it won't work! Inspiration has to find you working. :)

### Got a writers' group and want to do it together? Join a Group List!

When you have a full group, you'll pay just $116 AUD per month. Once there is enough people on the list, you will join a monthly, 5-person call. If you have 4 keen friends - or 4 other writers you meet with - it's a great option.

If you don't have a writers' group, you can [put your name on the list](https://brutalpixie.typeform.com/to/n55yGQ). As soon as we have our next 5 on the list, we'll launch the next group.
